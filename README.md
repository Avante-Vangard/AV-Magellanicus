# AV Magellan

At the suggestion of Christian Thalmann, This font has moved its base from Cormorant to EB Garamond.  I intend the final form to be main body text for general purpose typesetting in traditional style. Christian was clear that Cormorant is a display font, not a font for body text. 

This 2025 version is designed in FontForge. For this version I used a not-recommended import of the .ttf file. of EB Garamond, then copied Glyphs from Garamond-Math and others from within FontForge. I have not addressed any substitution tables yet.  So, very likely this font is an exploration that may eventually result in new glyphs in EB Garamond, Garamond-Math, or Cormorant, or another restart with with a more direct and accurate translation of the EB Garamond font into a font I can customize for typesetting. 

## AV Magellan 2025.08
Working release that primarily focused on filling in quoting pairs, and adding manuscript/editor marks (Coronis, Cornish Verse, Palm branch, a dotted cross or two. In most cases, the "condensed" quote pair is identical to the wide... will adjust when I get into typesetting examples. This is a working alpha to see it on screen and on paper to adjust the heights, widths and sizes. 

## AV Magellan 2025 (Jan)
This release focuses on glyphs book designers may find useful, including:
- enclosed numbers to 50 (useful for footnotes),
- enclosed alphabets (useful for dropcaps),
- an expanded set of brackets,
- an expanded  set of quote like marks,
- double struck letters,
- an expanded set of geometric shapes,
- Aegean tally marks (some used for quote like marks, but the set used for bullets,)
- an expanded set of section breaking characters, 
- and an expanded set of arrows. 

There are incomplete and probably outdated glyph maps of most of these new glyphs, (and a peek at my roadmap for more) in the [wiki](https://github.com/Avante-Vangard/AV-Magellanicus/wiki/Version-2025.001-notes).

I didn't really intend to be working on this font right now.  This was just answering the question "do I shelve or scrap _study Bible_ from my project list?" as I set priorities for 2025. I think I see room to contribute here without just making a mess, so my time in this effort hasn't been a squirrel chase. But, it's at a point I can put the font and the study bible back on the shelf.  

I will say I tried a light version (after adding only 5 or so glyphs.) FontForge seemed to do it well enough to release without too much effort. Heavier fonts are going to be work, since many of these glyphs have sharp corners and no available weight in their sources. But if anyone needs a light version of EB Garamond, submit a request.  I'll do it anyway eventually, but it might not be soon if it's only for me.
